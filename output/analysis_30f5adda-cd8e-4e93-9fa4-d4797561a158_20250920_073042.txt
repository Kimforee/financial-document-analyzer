Q2 2025 was a seminal point in Tesla’s history: the beginning of our transition from leading the 
electric vehicle and renewable energy industries to also becoming a leader in AI, robotics and 
related services. Our first Robotaxi service launched in Austin in June. While the service is 
limited in initial scope, we believe our approach to autonomy – a camera-only architecture with 
neural networks trained on data from our global fleet of millions of vehicles – allows us to 
continually improve safety, rapidly scale the network and improve profitability.
We continue to expand our vehicle offering, including first builds of a more affordable model in 
June, with volume production planned for the second half of 2025. Additionally, we continued 
development of Semi and Cybercab, both slated for volume production in 2026.
The Energy business is more critical than ever. The availability of clean, reliable energy is 
necessary for economic growth and an imperative for the development and commercialization 
of AI enabled products and services. As electricity demand grows, our Megapack product helps 
to increase utilization of existing generation and transmission capacity, resulting in a more 
efficient use of the electric grid. When paired with solar PV, Megapack is cost competitive with 
traditional fossil fuel generation assets and can be deployed 4x faster than traditional fossil fuel 
plants of the same capacity. Trailing twelve -month Energy storage deployments achieved their 
12th consecutive quarterly record.
Despite a sustained uncertain macroeconomic environment resulting from shifting tariffs, 
unclear impacts from changes to fiscal policy and political sentiment, we continue to make high -
value investments in CapEx and R&D, while ensuring a strong balance sheet. Our priorities 
remain the same: delivering affordable and compelling autonomy -capable models that 
maximize our global fleet of vehicles as our autonomy software continues to rapidly progress, 
growing the Energy business and advancing our robotics efforts.

Revenue Total revenue decreased 12% YoY to $22.5B. YoY, revenue was impacted by the following items:
- decline in vehicle deliveries
- lower regulatory credit revenue
- reduced vehicle average selling price (ASP) (excl. FX impact 1), due to mix
- decline in Energy Generation and Storage revenue due to lower ASP
+ growth in Services and Other
Profitability Our operating income decreased 42% YoY to $0.9B, resulting in a 4.1% operating margin. YoY, operating income was primarily impac ted 
by the following items:
- lower regulatory credit revenue
- increase in operating expenses (ex. restructuring and SBC) driven by AI and other R&D projects
- decline in vehicle deliveries
- increase in SBC
+ decrease in restructuring charges
+ lower cost per vehicle, due to mix and lower raw materials partially offset by lower fixed cost absorption and an increase in tariffs
+ growth in Energy Generation and Storage gross profit
Cash Quarter-end cash, cash equivalents and investments was $36.8B. The sequential decrease of $0.2B was primarily the result of changes in 
restricted cash and cash used in financing activities partially offset by free cash flow.

duty vehicles only; TTM = Trailing twelve months; Q2 data for Europe unavailable as of 
7/23/25.(1) Active driver supervision required; does not make the vehicle autonomous
We continue to make progress preparing for the launch of additional models this year. Our 
entire model lineup is better than ever with recent updates. Our ongoing focus on supply chain 
robustness has enabled a resilient vehicle capacity base despite trade and policy uncertainties. 
We produced our 8 -millionth vehicle in June .
US: California, Nevada and Texas
We had record test drives in North America, up 20% sequentially. Given the recent refreshes in 
our product portfolio and rapid improvement in FSD (Supervised)
1, it is paramount we maximize 
the number of prospective customers experiencing our vehicles. In May, the team launched the 
Long Range RWD Model Y with 357 miles of range, starting under $45k before incentives, 
opening the Model Y portfolio to more potential buyers.
APAC: Shanghai
Gigafactory Shanghai remains our main export hub and continues to support greater market 
expansion. We achieved record delivery volumes in South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines and 
Singapore. In July, we launched the Model Y in India, marking our entry into the world’s third-
largest car market. The refreshed Model 3 earned a 5 -star Overall Safety Rating from ANCAP, 
achieving 95% in the Child Occupant Protection pillar – the highest result recorded to date 
against ANCAP’s 2023-2025 criteria. We continue to prepare for broader release of FSD 
(Supervised)
1 in China this year, pending regulatory approval.
Europe and the Middle East: Berlin- Brandenburg
Model Y was the best -selling vehicle in Norway YTD and in Türkiye, Netherlands, Switzerland and 
Austria in June. The refreshed Model 3 achieved a 5 -star Overall Safety Rating from EuroNCAP 
and is the safest car in Europe based on the latest EuroNCAP test scores. We continue to 
prepare for the launch of FSD (Supervised) 1 in Europe this year, pending regulatory approval.7

Artificial Intelligence Software and Hardware
In June, we launched our Robotaxi service in the first city, Austin, with a safety rider. We will 
further improve and expand the service (more vehicles covering a larger area, eventually without 
a safety rider) while testing in other U.S. cities in anticipation of additional launches. Our efforts to 
refine the Robotaxi offering in Austin are not location- specific and will allow us to scale to other 
cities quickly with marginal investment. We achieved the world's first autonomous delivery to a 
customer with a new production Model Y driving itself ~30 minutes from the factory across town 
to its new owner's home, including on highways. We expanded AI training compute with an 
additional 16k H200 GPUs at Gigafactory Texas, bringing Cortex to a total of 67k H100 equivalents.
Vehicle and Other Software
Our cars get better over time: a 2017 Model 3 owner today has access to features that did not 
exist when their car was built - improved security and safety (Sentry Mode, Dashcam Viewer, 
Automatic Blind Spot Camera, Dog Mode), increased convenience (Tesla Profiles, mobile app Trip 
Planner, battery preconditioning for faster Supercharging) and entertainment options (Netflix, 
YouTube, etc.) among many others –  all delivered for free via software updates.
We launched the Robotaxi mobile app, which leverages existing Tesla app features and provides a 
seamless customer experience. With a Tesla Profile, customers can request a ride, follow the 
vehicle’s location, preset cabin temperature, unlock the car using their phone, have access to 
their favorite entertainment and securely pay for the ride with their payment profile. 
Battery, Powertrain and Manufacturing
Our lithium refining and cathode production plants remain on track to begin production in 2025, 
on-shoring production of critical battery materials to the U.S. We are on course to begin domestic 
production of our first LFP cells for our energy storage products later this year.

Energy Storage deployments (TTM; GWh)
Energy and Services and Other  gross profit (TTM; $M)
Energy storage deployments continue to grow as we expand capacity for both Megapack and 
Powerwall to meet demand globally. Services and Other – a collection of businesses that mainly 
supports vehicle sales – also continues to grow alongside our global fleet of vehicles.
Energy Generation and Storage
Energy storage deployments once again increased on a trailing twelve -month (TTM) basis, 
including record Powerwall deployments for the fifth consecutive quarter. G ross profit increased 
sequentially and year -over-year, reaching a record of $846 million. We started deploying 
Megapacks from Megafactory Shanghai as the ramp continues as planned. Regionalizing energy 
storage manufacturing capacity is critical for meeting demand given shifting tariff, trade and 
fiscal policies globally.
Services and Other
Services and Other gross profit grew 64% sequentially, partly due to improved Supercharging 
gross profit generation from increased volume. We added over 2,900 net new Supercharging 
stalls, growing the network 18% year -over-year. 
As we continue redefining the vehicle buying and ownership experience, we have integrated AI 
agents to help resolve customer queries, reduce wait times for service and even provide 
assistance when placing an order for accessories, parts and products without having to wait for a 
person. We are leveraging this same technology in our service technician workflow to help 
improve turnaround times for service.

Volume It is difficult to measure the impacts of shifting global trade and fiscal policies on the automotive and energy supply chain s, our cost 
structure and demand for durable goods and related services. While we are making prudent investments that will set up both ou r vehicle 
and energy businesses for growth, the actual results will depend on a variety of factors, including the broader macroeconomic 
environment, the rate of acceleration of our autonomy efforts and production ramp at our factories.
Cash We have sufficient liquidity to fund our product roadmap, long -term capacity expansion plans and other expenses. Furthermore, we  will 
manage the business such that we maintain a strong balance sheet during this uncertain period.
Profit While we continue to execute on innovations to reduce the cost of manufacturing and operations, over time, we expect our hard ware-
related profits to be accompanied by an acceleration of AI, software and fleet -based profits.
Product Our focus remains on prudently growing our vehicle volumes in a capex efficient manner by using our existing vehicle producti on capacity 
before building new lines. Plans for new vehicles that will launch in 2025 remain on track, including initial production of a  more affordable 
model in 1H25. 
Our purpose-built Robotaxi product – Cybercab – will continue to pursue a revolutionary “unboxed” manufacturing strategy and is 
scheduled for volume production starting in 2026.
